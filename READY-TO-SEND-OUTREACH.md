## Email #1 — First Touch (Send Day 1)

**To:** (Get email from in-person visit or call)
**Subject (Option 1 — RECOMMENDED):** I built Palm Thai a new website — take a look
**Subject (Option 2):** Samuel, I redesigned Palm Thai's website
**Subject (Option 3):** A gift for Palm Thai — no strings attached

**Body:**

Hi Samuel,

I had lunch at Palm Thai a few weeks ago — the Khao Soi Chicken was incredible, easily some of the best Thai food in Tampa. Your 4.6 Google rating with over 660 reviews speaks for itself.

I'm a web designer and I was so impressed by Palm Thai that I went ahead and built you a brand new website — completely free, no obligation.

Take a look: https://palm-thai.vercel.app

Your current Wix site loads in 1.78 seconds and costs you $17-32/month. This one loads in under 1 second, and it's a one-time cost.

A few things I included:
- **Online ordering integration** — customers can order directly from your site
- **Your 847+ reviews** from Google and Yelp featured prominently with your 4.55 composite rating
- **Professional photo gallery** showcasing your popular dishes (Khao Soi, Chu Chee Crispy Duck, Drunken Noodles)
- **Mobile-optimized design** (60% of restaurant searches are mobile) with Google Maps integration
- **Highlighted your $8.95 lunch special** — great for converting lunch traffic
- **Instagram and Facebook integration** — your social presence showcased properly

Palm Thai has become a Tampa institution — your website should reflect the quality of your food.

If you like it, I can have it live on your domain within 24 hours for $150/mo (includes the website and monthly maintenance). If not, no worries at all.

## Email #3 — Final Touch (Send Day 8)

**To:** (Get email from in-person visit or call)
**Subject:** Last note about Palm Thai's website

**Body:**

Hi Samuel,

I know running Palm Thai keeps you incredibly busy, so I'll keep this short.

The website I built is still ready for you: https://palm-thai.vercel.app

If the timing isn't right, I completely understand. I'll keep it live for another week in case you want to share it with your team.

If you'd prefer to discuss over the phone instead of email, feel free to call or text me at [YOUR PHONE]. Or I'm happy to stop by during your slower hours (I know 2-4 PM is usually quieter).

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

## Facebook Message

Hi Samuel! 👋

I'm a customer and a big fan of Palm Thai — your Pad Thai is the best I've had in Tampa. I noticed your website could use an upgrade, so I went ahead and built you a new one as a portfolio piece.

Check it out: https://palm-thai.vercel.app

I included online ordering, all 847+ of your Google/Yelp reviews, your full menu with photos, and your lunch special. No pitch — just wanted to share it with you. If you like it, we can talk. If not, no worries!

Let me know what you think!

## In-Person Script (RECOMMENDED APPROACH)

### When to Visit
**Best time:** 2-4 PM (between lunch and dinner rush)
**Avoid:** 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM, 5:30 PM - 8:30 PM (peak service times)

### Opening
*Approach host stand or manager on duty*

"Hi, is Samuel available? I'm [YOUR NAME] — I'm not here about a reservation or anything like that. I actually built a new website for Palm Thai and wanted to show it to him. It'll just take 2 minutes."

*If Samuel is busy:*
"No problem at all. What's the best time to come back when he has a few minutes? I can come by tomorrow if that works better."

### Pitch (when you meet Samuel)
*Pull up https://palm-thai.vercel.app on your phone or tablet*

"Hi Samuel, I'm [YOUR NAME]. I had lunch here a few weeks ago and was so impressed that I went ahead and designed a brand new website for Palm Thai — this is it right here."

*Show him the site, scroll through key sections*

"I noticed your current site on Wix doesn't have online ordering, doesn't show your amazing reviews, and doesn't have a photo gallery. So I added all of that — your 4.6 Google rating with 661 reviews, your Yelp photos, your full menu, the lunch special, everything."

*Scroll to reviews section*

"You've got 847 total reviews between Google and Yelp. That's incredible for a restaurant. People should see that right away when they visit your site."

### Value Proposition
"Your current Wix site costs you $17-32 a month and loads pretty slowly. This one loads in under a second, includes online ordering integration, and I can have it live on your domain today for $150 a month. That includes the website and ongoing management — I'll keep it updated, make changes whenever you need them, no extra charge."

### Handling Common Responses

**"Let me think about it"**
"Absolutely, take your time. The site is live at palm-thai.vercel.app — you can pull it up anytime and show it to your team. Here's my card with the link. Call or text me if you have any questions."

**"How much?"**
"$150 a month, and that includes everything — the website, hosting, updates, and monthly management. If you ever need menu changes or want to add new photos, just send them to me and I'll update it within 24 hours."

**"I already have a website"**
"I saw that — it's on Wix, right? The new one I built is quite a bit faster and it's got some features yours is missing, like online ordering and customer reviews. The site is live right now at palm-thai.vercel.app if you want to pull it up and compare them side-by-side."

**"I'm not interested right now"**
"No problem at all. The site will stay live for the next few weeks if you change your mind. I'm local, so feel free to reach out anytime. And by the way — the Khao Soi is amazing. Keep doing what you're doing."

**"Can you email me the information?"**
"Absolutely. What's the best email for you? I'll send you the link and a quick comparison of the current site vs. the new one."

**"I have a friend who does websites"**
"That's great. They can check out the code quality and performance at palm-thai.vercel.app — it's built with modern tech, scores high on Google's speed tests, and has all the SEO optimization built in. If they have any technical questions, I'm happy to talk to them."

### Close
"The site is ready to go. If you want to move forward, I can transfer it to your domain today and you'll be live by tonight. Sound good?"

*If yes:* "Great! I'll need access to your domain registrar — do you know if you have access to that, or should I coordinate with whoever manages your Wix account?"

*If no:* "No worries. Here's my card with the link. Take a look when you get a chance and let me know. Thanks for your time, Samuel!"

### Leave-Behind
*Hand him a business card or printed page with:*
- Your name and contact info
- The URL: https://palm-thai.vercel.app
- One-line pitch: "New website for Palm Thai — online ordering, reviews, photos, SEO — $150/mo"

## Phone Script (BACKUP OPTION)

### Opening
"Hi, could I speak with Samuel Gharouni? ... Hi Samuel, my name is [YOUR NAME]. I'm a web designer here in Tampa — I know you're busy so I'll be quick."

### Pitch (30 seconds)
"I'm a big fan of Palm Thai and I actually went ahead and designed a brand new website for you. It's already live at palm-thai.vercel.app if you want to pull it up. I included your full menu with photos, online ordering, and your amazing reviews — you've got over 847 between Google and Yelp with a 4.55 composite rating."

### Comparison (if they engage)
"Your current site on Wix loads in about 1.78 seconds and costs you $17-32 a month. The new one loads in under a second, includes online ordering, and highlights your lunch special. Plus it's mobile-optimized, which matters because over 60% of restaurant searches are on phones now."

### Close
"If you like what you see, I can have it live on your actual domain within 24 hours. It's $150 a month, includes the website and ongoing management. No separate hosting fees, and I'll update it anytime you need."

### Objection Handling

**"I'm not interested"**
"No problem at all. The site will stay live at palm-thai.vercel.app for the next couple weeks if you change your mind. Thanks for your time, Samuel."

**"I already have a website"**
"I saw that — it's on Wix, right? The new one I built is quite a bit faster and it's got some features yours is missing, like online ordering and customer review integration. Take a look at palm-thai.vercel.app and see what you think."

**"How much?"**
"$150 a month. That includes the design, development, hosting, and ongoing management. If you ever need menu updates or photo changes, just send them to me and I'll update it within 24 hours. No extra charges."

**"I need to think about it"**
"Absolutely, take your time. I'll send you an email or text with the link and a comparison so you can review it when it's convenient. What's the best way to reach you — email or text?"

**"Can you do it cheaper?"**
"The site is already built, so what you see is what you get. I normally charge significantly more for restaurant websites — this is a special offer because I'm building my portfolio in the Tampa restaurant space."

**"I'll have my web person look at it"**
"Great idea. They can check out the code quality at palm-thai.vercel.app — it's built with modern tech, loads fast under a second, and scores well on Google's speed tests. Happy to answer any technical questions they have."

**"We don't have budget right now"**
"I understand. The good news is the site is already built, so there's no upfront cost — just the $150 monthly management fee. And it actually saves you money compared to what you're paying for Wix right now. But if the timing isn't right, I can follow up in a few months."
