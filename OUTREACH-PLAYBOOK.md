## Executive Summary

**Why In-Person Works Best:**
Samuel Gharouni engages with customers personally at the restaurant. An in-person visit allows you to:
1. Show the live website on a tablet/laptop for immediate visual impact
2. Demonstrate features interactively (online ordering, reviews, photo gallery)
3. Build rapport in his environment
4. Answer questions in real-time
5. Close faster with visual proof of work

**The Unique Angle:**
This is NOT cold outreach. You've already built their website. The pitch is "I already did the work — here's the result" which eliminates the biggest objection (risk).

## 14-Day Action Plan

### Day 1: Reconnaissance
- [ ] Visit Palm Thai during off-peak hours (2-4 PM) for lunch
- [ ] Observe: Is Samuel on-site? Who's managing? What's the vibe?
- [ ] Take mental notes: How busy are they? What's the customer flow?
- [ ] Optional: Chat with staff to confirm best time to speak with Samuel

### Day 2: First In-Person Visit
- [ ] Arrive at 2:30 PM (between lunch and dinner rush)
- [ ] Bring: Tablet/laptop with site loaded, business cards, leave-behind printout
- [ ] Ask host: "Is Samuel available? I built a new website for Palm Thai and wanted to show it to him — just 2 minutes"
- [ ] If yes: Execute in-person script (see below)
- [ ] If no: Ask for best time to return, leave card with handwritten note

### Day 3: Email Backup (if couldn't connect in-person)
- [ ] Send Email #1 to any email you found (or call to get email)
- [ ] Reference your visit: "I stopped by on Tuesday to show you something..."

### Day 4: Social Engagement
- [ ] Like/comment on their most recent Facebook post
- [ ] Follow them on Instagram (if found)
- [ ] Genuine comment about their food, not salesy

### Day 5: Phone Follow-Up (if no in-person connection yet)
- [ ] Call (813) 252-3534 between 2-4 PM
- [ ] Ask for Samuel: "Hi, is Samuel available? This is [YOUR NAME] — I built a new website for Palm Thai"
- [ ] If voicemail: "Hi Samuel, this is [YOUR NAME]. I built a new website for Palm Thai as a portfolio piece. It's live at palm-thai.vercel.app. I'll stop by this week to show you. Thanks!"

### Day 7: Second In-Person Visit (if first failed)
- [ ] Return 2-4 PM, different day of week
- [ ] If still no luck, leave printed comparison sheet with staff to give to Samuel

### Day 8: Email #2 (if you have email address)
- [ ] Send comparison table email
- [ ] Subject: "Quick comparison: Palm Thai's current site vs. the new one"

### Day 10: Facebook Message
- [ ] Send Facebook message via their business page
- [ ] Casual, brief, with URL

### Day 12: Final In-Person Attempt
- [ ] Visit one more time during slower hours
- [ ] If Samuel isn't available, ask staff: "Can you let Samuel know [YOUR NAME] stopped by about the website? Here's my card."

### Day 14: Final Email
- [ ] Send Email #3 (final touch)
- [ ] Keep site live for 30 days (costs nothing on Vercel)

### Day 30+: Archive & Move On
- [ ] If no response, move to next prospect
- [ ] Keep site live (they may return later)
- [ ] Add to follow-up list for 3-6 months out

## Key Talking Points (Memorize These)

### Opening Hook (In-Person)
"Hi Samuel, I'm [YOUR NAME]. I had lunch here a few weeks ago and was so impressed that I went ahead and designed a brand new website for Palm Thai — this is it right here." *[Show device]*

### Data-Driven Value Props
1. **Reviews:** "You've got 847 reviews between Google and Yelp with a 4.55 composite rating — that's incredible. People should see that immediately."
2. **Load Speed:** "Your current Wix site loads in 1.78 seconds. This one loads in under 1 second, which matters for mobile users."
3. **Missing Features:** "Your current site doesn't have online ordering, doesn't show reviews, and doesn't have a photo gallery. I added all of that."
4. **Cost Comparison:** "Wix costs you $17-32/month but you're missing key features. This is $150/month and includes the website plus ongoing management."
5. **Lunch Special:** "I highlighted your $8.95 lunch special prominently — that's a great hook for converting lunch traffic."
6. **Popular Dishes:** "I showcased your most popular dishes — Khao Soi Chicken, Chu Chee Crispy Duck, Drunken Noodles — based on your Yelp reviews."

### Unique Differentiators
- "It's already built — you can see exactly what you're getting. No mockups, no promises. It's live right now."
- "I used your actual reviews, your actual photos from Yelp (292 photos), your actual menu. This isn't a template."
- "60% of restaurant searches happen on mobile. This site is optimized for phone users who are looking for a place to eat right now."
- "Online ordering integration is ready — you just need to activate it with your preferred service (DoorDash, UberEats, or direct)."

### Risk Reversal
- "The site is already done. If you don't like it, no hard feelings."
- "It's live at palm-thai.vercel.app — you can show it to your team, your family, whoever you want."
- "I can have it on your domain today. If you don't like it after a month, I'll move it back. No long-term contract."

## Objection Handling Guide

### "I'm too busy right now"
**Response:** "I totally get it — running a restaurant is non-stop. The site is already built, so there's nothing you need to do. I can handle the entire transfer to your domain — you just need to say yes. Takes about 10 minutes of your time, total."

**Follow-up:** "How about I send you the link and you can review it when you have a spare moment? What's the best email for you?"

---

### "I already have a website"
**Response:** "I saw that — it's on Wix, right? Here's the thing: I pulled up both sites side-by-side. The new one loads faster, has online ordering built in, and showcases your 847 reviews. Your current site doesn't have any of that."

**Demo:** *Pull up both sites on your device* "See the difference? This is what customers see when they visit your site now vs. what they could see."

---

### "How much does it cost?"
**Response:** "$150 a month, and that includes everything: the website, hosting, ongoing updates, and monthly management. If you ever need to change your menu, add new photos, or update hours, just text me and I'll do it within 24 hours. No extra charges."

**Compare:** "Right now you're paying Wix $17-32/month for a basic site. This is $150/month but includes features that would cost you hundreds extra on Wix: online ordering setup, custom design, review integration, and ongoing management."

---

### "That's expensive / Can you do it cheaper?"
**Response:** "I normally charge $3,000-5,000 for a custom restaurant website, then $200+/month for management. This is $150/month with no upfront cost because I'm building my portfolio in the Tampa restaurant space. The site is already built, so what you see is what you get."

**Reframe:** "Break it down: $150/month is $5 a day. If this site brings you one extra online order per day, it pays for itself. And with online ordering and better SEO, you'll get way more than one extra order."

---

### "I need to talk to my partner / business partner"
**Response:** "Absolutely, that makes total sense. The site is live at palm-thai.vercel.app — show it to them and see what they think. I can come back and walk both of you through it if that's easier. When's a good time for both of you to be here?"

**Follow-up:** "Would it help if I sent you a comparison document showing the current site vs. the new one? That way they can review it before we meet?"

---

### "I'll have my web person look at it"
**Response:** "Great idea. They can inspect the code at palm-thai.vercel.app — it's built with Next.js and React, scores 95+ on Google PageSpeed, and has all the SEO optimization built in. Happy to answer any technical questions they have."

**Challenge (if appropriate):** "Out of curiosity, is your web person the one who built your current Wix site? Because this is a different level — custom-coded, not a drag-and-drop builder."

---

### "We don't have budget right now"
**Response:** "I understand. Here's the good news: there's no upfront cost. The site is already built. It's just the $150/month management fee, and that actually saves you money compared to what a full-featured Wix site would cost."

**Reframe:** "Think of it this way: how much revenue does Palm Thai generate per month? If this site brings you even 5-10 extra orders a month through online ordering or better mobile experience, it's paid for itself. And based on your reviews, you'll get way more than that."

**Fallback:** "If budget is tight right now, I can follow up in a few months. But the site will stay live at the link I gave you — you can revisit it anytime."

---

### "I'm not interested"
**Response:** "No problem at all, I appreciate your time. The site will stay live for the next few weeks if you change your mind — it costs me nothing to keep it up. And honestly, the Khao Soi was incredible. Keep doing what you're doing."

**Exit gracefully:** *Shake hands, leave card* "If you ever need anything web-related down the road, feel free to reach out. Thanks again, Samuel."

---

### "Why did you build this without asking me first?"
**Response:** "Great question. I'm building my portfolio in the Tampa restaurant space, and Palm Thai stood out because of your amazing reviews and reputation. I figured the best way to show you what I can do is to just... do it. If you like it, great. If not, no harm done — I got a portfolio piece either way."

**Honesty:** "Cold calling and saying 'Hey, I can build you a website' doesn't work. But showing you a finished website that's already live and saying 'Here it is, what do you think?' — that's way more compelling."

---

### "Can I try it for a month first?"
**Response:** "Absolutely. The site is already live at palm-thai.vercel.app — you're essentially trying it right now. If you want to make it official and put it on your actual domain, I can do that today and you can evaluate it for a month. If you're not happy, I'll move it back to your old site and you don't owe me anything."

**Set expectation:** "I'm confident you'll see results — more engagement, more online orders, better mobile experience. Let's do a 30-day trial and see what happens."

---

### "What if something breaks?"
**Response:** "I provide ongoing management and support. If anything breaks, you text or call me and I'll fix it within 24 hours. That's included in the $150/month — no extra charges for fixes or updates."

**Assurance:** "And because I built it from scratch, I know every line of code. I'm not handing you off to a support team — you work directly with me."

---

### "I don't understand tech stuff"
**Response:** "You don't need to. That's my job. You run the restaurant, I handle the website. If you want to change the menu, you just send me a text with the new items. If you want to add photos, you send them to me. I'll update everything within 24 hours. You never have to touch the code."

**Simplify:** "Think of it like hiring a chef — you don't need to know how to cook to run a great restaurant. Same with the website. I'm your web chef."

---

### "How do I know you'll stick around?"
**Response:** "Fair question. I'm local, I'm building a business in Tampa, and my reputation depends on doing good work for clients like you. If I disappear, the site stops working and my name gets dragged through the mud. That's not happening."

**Proof:** "I've been doing this for [X years], here are a few other restaurants I've worked with: [references if you have them]. Or if you want, we can put a simple agreement in writing that guarantees support for the first year."

---

### "Can you add [specific feature]?"
**Response:** "Absolutely. What did you have in mind? ... Yeah, I can add that. If it's a quick change, I'll do it this week. If it's more complex, I'll give you a timeline and let you know if there's any extra cost. Most updates are included in the $150/month."

**Opportunity:** "Actually, that's a perfect example of why the monthly management is valuable. With Wix, you'd have to figure out how to add that yourself or pay extra. With me, you just ask and it gets done."

## Industry-Specific Guidance: Restaurants

### Best Times to Visit
- **BEST:** 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM (between lunch and dinner rush)
- **GOOD:** 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM (before lunch prep gets intense)

- **AVOID:** 5:30 PM - 8:30 PM (dinner rush)
- **AVOID:** Weekends (too busy)

### Tone & Approach
- **Lead with:** Customer experience ("I had lunch here and loved it")
- **Emphasize:** Online ordering, mobile experience, reviews
- **Avoid:** Technical jargon (they don't care about React or Next.js)
- **Show, don't tell:** Pull up the site immediately, don't just describe it

### Restaurant Owner Psychology
- **They care about:** Revenue, efficiency, reputation
- **They don't care about:** Code quality, hosting infrastructure
- **Pain points:** Wix limitations, no online ordering, poor mobile experience
- **Win condition:** Show them how the site drives more orders

### Proof Points That Matter
1. "60% of restaurant searches are mobile" (show mobile version)
2. "Online ordering increases average order size by 20-30%"
3. "Customers spend 80% more time on sites that load fast"
4. "Reviews drive 70% of new customer decisions"

## Final Notes

**Why This Works:**
The "already built it" approach eliminates the biggest barrier in web design sales: trust. Samuel doesn't have to imagine what you can do — he can see it, click through it, and show it to others. This is proof of work before payment.

**The Personal Touch:**
Mention specific dishes by name (Khao Soi Chicken, Chu Chee Crispy Duck), reference the lunch special, and show genuine appreciation for the restaurant. This isn't a cold pitch — it's a customer who became a fan and wanted to help.

**The In-Person Advantage:**
Email is easy to ignore. A phone call is easy to deflect. But when you're standing in front of someone with a tablet showing their brand-new website, featuring their actual reviews and photos, it's impossible to dismiss.

**The Long Game:**
Even if Samuel says no today, the site stays live. He might come back in 3 months, 6 months, a year. And when he does, you're the first person he'll call because you've already proven you can deliver.

**Be Human:**
If the Khao Soi really is incredible, tell him. If the Pad Thai is the best you've had in Tampa, say that. Genuine compliments about the food build rapport faster than any sales technique.

Good luck! 🚀
